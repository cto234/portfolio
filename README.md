# Portfolio - Connor O'Doherty

I made this portfolio site using React.js and Sass for the styling. My intention was to use this as a tool I can use to introduce myself and display my talents and works for potential employers. The site includes a homepage, an about page which has a short biography and personal info, including a link to my resume, a projects page which contains links and demos to all of my personal projects, and a contact page. Thanks for looking.
